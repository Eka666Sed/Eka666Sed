- 👋 Hi, I’m Ekaterina Sedova. I’m an Android Developer.
- 👀 I’m interested in turning caffeine and code into magic.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make Android apps even more addictive than social media.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that are as awesome as my cat.
- 📫 How to reach me: Just send a smoke signal (or an email, whichever is easier).
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her, but you can call me "Code Queen".
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once debugged a nightmare code at 3 AM and lived to tell the tale.
